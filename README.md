About QP/C++
============
QP/C++ (Quantum Platform in C++) is a lightweight, open source software
framework for building responsive and modular real-time embedded applications
as systems of cooperating, event-driven active objects (actors). The QP/C++
framework is a member of a larger family consisting of QP/C, QP/C++, and
QP-nano frameworks, which are all strictly quality controlled, thoroughly
documented, and commercially licensable.

All QP frameworks can run on bare-metal single-chip microcontrollers,
completely replacing a traditional Real-Time Operating System (RTOS).
Ports and ready-to-use examples are provided for major CPU families.

QP/C++ can also work with many traditional RTOSes and desktop OSes (such as
Windows, Linux including embedded Linux).

The behavior of active objects is specified in QP by means of hierarchical
state machines (UML statecharts). The frameworks support manual coding of
UML state machines in C or C++ as well as fully automatic code generation
by means of the free graphical QM modeling tool.

The QP frameworks are used in millions of products worldwide in aerospace,
medical devices, consumer electronics, wired and wireless telecommunications,
industrial automation, transportation, robotics, and many more. The QP
frameworks and the QM modeling tool receive over 40,000 downloads a year.

The book, Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++, 2nd Edition provides a detailed
design study of the QP frameworks and explains all the related concepts.

Licensing QP/C++
================
QP/C++ is licensed under the increasingly popular dual licensing model, in
which both the open source software distribution mechanism and traditional
closed source software distribution models are combined.

****
NOTE: If your company has a policy forbidding open source in your product,
all QP frameworks can be licensed commercially, in which case you don't use
any open source license and you do not violate your policy.

Open Source Projects:
--------------------
If you are developing and distributing open source applications under the
GNU General Public License (GPL), as published by the Free Software
Foundation, then you are free to use the Quantum Leaps software under the
GPL version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. Please
note that GPL requires that all modifications to the original code as well
as your application code (Derivative Works as defined in the Copyright Law)
must also be released under the terms of the GPL open source license.

Closed Source Projects:
-----------------------
If you are developing and distributing traditional closed source
applications, you can purchase one of Quantum Leaps commercial licenses,
which are specifically designed for users interested in retaining the
proprietary status of their code. All Quantum Leaps commercial licenses
expressly supersede the GPL open source license. This means that when you
license Quantum Leaps software under a commercial license, you specifically
do not use the software under the open source license and therefore you are
not subject to any of its terms.
